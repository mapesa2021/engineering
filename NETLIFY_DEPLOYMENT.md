# Netlify Deployment Guide for Olerum Engineering

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with your project repository
- Netlify account (free at netlify.com)

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git Repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Olerum Engineering website"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to github.com and create a new repository
   - Name it something like "olerum-engineering-website"

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/olerum-engineering-website.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: Deploy via Netlify UI (Recommended for beginners)

   - **Publish directory**: `.next`
   - **Node version**: 18 (or latest LTS)

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Option B: Deploy via Netlify CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:

## Step 4: Environment Variables (if needed)

If you need environment variables:
1. Go to Site settings > Environment variables
2. Add any required variables

## Step 5: Continuous Deployment

- Every time you push to your main branch, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy
- You can preview deployments on pull requests

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- Check the build logs in Netlify
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Image Issues
- Ensure all image URLs are accessible
- Consider using Netlify's image optimization

### Performance

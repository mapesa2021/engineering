# Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The Netlify deployment was failing because:
1. The `netlify.toml` file was configured for a Next.js project with `npm run export` command
2. Our project is actually a Vite/React project, not Next.js
3. There was no "export" script in our `package.json`
4. There were configuration conflicts with PostCSS/TailwindCSS

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`
- Changed build command from `npm run export` to `npm run build`
- Changed publish directory from `out` to `dist`
- Updated comments to reflect Vite project configuration

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Added "export" script that runs the same commands as "build": `tsc -b && vite build`
- Kept all existing scripts intact

### 3. Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Added `base: './'` for proper static asset handling
- Added build configuration for output directory and asset handling
- Kept existing React plugin configuration

### 4. Fixed `src/App.tsx`
- Removed unused React import to fix TypeScript warning

### 5. Removed PostCSS Configuration
- Deleted `postcss.config.js` since we're not using TailwindCSS
- Our project uses custom CSS utility classes instead

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run export` locally
- Successfully ran `npm run preview` to test the built application
- Application is accessible at http://localhost:4173/

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy to Netlify:
1. Commit all changes to the repository
2. Push to the branch connected to Netlify
3. Netlify should now automatically build and deploy the application

The build process will:
1. Run `npm run export` (which executes `tsc -b && vite build`)
2. Output files to the `dist` directory
3. Serve the static files from the `dist` directory

## Additional Notes
- The project is now properly configured for static deployment
- All modern UI features (popup modals, loading animations, payment integration) will work in the deployed version
- The backend API will need to be hosted separately (e.g., on Render or Heroku) for the payment functionality to work

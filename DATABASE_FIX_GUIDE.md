# Database Fix Guide

## Problem
The admin panel was using localStorage instead of the Supabase database, which meant:
- Changes were only visible on the same browser/device
- Data didn't persist across different devices or browsers
- Data was lost when localStorage was cleared

## Solution
I've updated the system to use Supabase database with localStorage as a fallback.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Update Database Schema
Run the updated `database-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the missing tables:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of database-setup.sql into Supabase SQL Editor
-- This will create the missing tables: projects, newsletter_subscribers, site_settings, buttons_config
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Test the Fix
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/admin/hero` and make changes
3. Check that changes persist when you refresh the page
4. Check that changes are visible on other devices/browsers

## What Changed

### adminData.ts
- All functions are now async and use Supabase database
- localStorage is used as a fallback if database fails
- Added proper error handling and logging

### Database Schema
- Added missing tables: `projects`, `newsletter_subscribers`, `site_settings`, `buttons_config`
- Updated existing tables to match the interface requirements

### Admin Pages
- Updated to handle async functions
- Added proper error handling

## Benefits
- ✅ Data persists across all devices and browsers
- ✅ Changes are stored in a real database
- ✅ Fallback to localStorage if database is unavailable
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Scalable solution for production

## Troubleshooting

### If changes still don't persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
3. Check if database tables were created successfully
4. Ensure you're logged in as admin

### If you see database errors:
1. Check Supabase dashboard for table structure
2. Verify RLS (Row Level Security) policies
3. Check if the tables exist in your database

## Migration from localStorage
If you have existing data in localStorage that you want to migrate to the database:

1. Export the data from localStorage (check browser dev tools)
2. Create a migration script to insert the data into Supabase
3. Or manually recreate the data through the admin panel

## Next Steps
After implementing this fix:
1. Test all admin functionality
2. Update other admin pages to use async functions
3. Consider adding data validation
4. Add proper authentication and authorization
